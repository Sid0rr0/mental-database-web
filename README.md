**Work in progress**

This is website for my sister's bachelor thesis and didn't have much time so there is no backend (comming) and lot of stuff is hardcoded and made in haste.
Also it is supposed to be viewed on smartphones right now (other screens sizes will come).


Made using Next.js, Chakra UI and Typescript.
